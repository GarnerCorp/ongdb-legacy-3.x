Feature: MergeLegacyAcceptance

  Scenario: Using a single bound node
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)
      MERGE (a)-[r:TYPE]->()
      RETURN count(r)
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | count(r) |
      | 1        |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 1 |
      | +relationships | 1 |

  Scenario: Using a longer pattern
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:A)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (a:A)
      MERGE (a)-[r:TYPE]->()<-[:TYPE]-()
      RETURN count(r)
      """
    Then the result should be:

    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 2 |
      | +relationships | 2 |

  Scenario: Using bound nodes in mid-pattern
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (:B)
      """
    When executing query:
      """
      MATCH (b:B)

    Then the result should be:

    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 2 |
      | +relationships | 2 |

  Scenario: Using bound nodes in mid-pattern when pattern partly matches
    Given an empty graph
    And having executed:
      """
      CREATE (a:A), (b:B)
      CREATE (a)-[:TYPE]->(b)
      """
    When executing query:

      """
    Then the result should be:
      | type(r1) | type(r2) |
      | 'TYPE'   | 'TYPE'   |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 2 |
      | +relationships | 2 |
      | +labels        | 1 |

  Scenario: Introduce named paths
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE (a:A)
      MERGE p = (a)-[:R]->()
      RETURN p
      """
    Then the result should be:
      | p               |
      | <(:A)-[:R]->()> |
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 2 |
      | +relationships | 1 |
      | +labels        | 1 |

  Scenario: Unbound pattern
    Given an empty graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE ({name: 'Andres'})-[:R]->({name: 'Emil'})
      """
    Then the result should be empty
    And the side effects should be:
      | +nodes         | 2 |
      | +relationships | 1 |
      | +properties    | 2 |

  Scenario: Fail when imposing new predicates on a variable that is already bound
    Given any graph
    When executing query:
      """
      MERGE (a:Foo)-[r:KNOWS]->(a:Bar)
      """
    Then a SyntaxError should be raised at compile time: VariableAlreadyBound
