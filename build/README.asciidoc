= ONgDB CodeStyle =

If you are using Intellij IDEA for developing ONgDB,
you can import the link:ongdb-intellij.xml[ongdb-intellij.xml] styleguide from this directory.

We have simply taken the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j/neo4j.github.com/master/code-style/neo4j-intellij.xml[neo4j-intellij.xml] file,
renamed it to `ongdb-intellij.xml`
and added a few package rules to allow `org.graphfoundation.*` package names.
