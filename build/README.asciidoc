= ONgDB CodeStyle =

If you are using Intellij IDEA for developing ONgDB, you can import the ongdb-intellij.xml styleguide from
this directory.

We have simply taken the neo4j-intellij.xml file, renamed it to ongdb-intellij.xml and added a few package rules to allow 
org.graphfoundation.* package names.
